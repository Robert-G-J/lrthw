mathematical operators +,-,*,**,/,%

variable = an object that can be set to file, string, integer, float, boolean,..
Integer/float variables can take mathematical operations by name, e.g.
my_age * my_height = .....

function/method
A small script that takes 0-n arguments and can return some result. When defining, could use def print_two (*args);end to set multiple arguments within the method

ARGV
An array of variables that are initialised for calling from the command line

File.open, .read, .close, .seek(), .write, .truncate(n)
Methods belonging to the IO class that work on files.

FORMATTING
String interpolation #{} interrupts a string and calls in a variable as an argument

%{} is a formatting consensus for string format. E.g. %{drink} could be called in a string with %{drink: "ale"}, where 'drink' would be replaced with 'ale'.

String can be printed to stdout with integers: e.g. print "OUCH!"*10
SEE EXERCISE 08

IO
stdin, stdout and stderr are the three channels by which the computer communicates.
IO calls are useful when we set command line variables

.gets is used to pull a response from stdin
.chomp cuts of the trailing line break from an input.

ESCAPE CHARACTERS
Used to allow special characters in a string or a regular expression (regex).
See my cheatsheet.

INTEGER
Methods that act on numbers, such as:
.to_i, to_f,
